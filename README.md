# YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a large-scale project developed during Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy.
It is a website that allows users to add their own campgrounds, including details such as prices, locations, images, and descriptions.
Users can also edit or delete the campgrounds they have created. Additionally, users can add reviews to any campground, whether they created it or not.
